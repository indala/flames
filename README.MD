hello buddies!

There here is the place where u can find ur solemate .
It's a popular game that's often played by young people to predict the relationship between two individuals. 
The name "FLAMES" is an acronym representing the six possible outcomes: Friends, Lovers, Admirers, Marriage, Enemies, and Siblings.
The game involves taking the names of the two people involved, crossing out letters that are common to both names, and then counting the remaining letters to determine the result.
It's more of a fun and lighthearted game rather than a serious predictor of relationships!
